# stereo
Simple utilities I'm using to process photo pairs into single stereo images.

A good stereo viewer that can be used with this project is available through
the London Stereoscopic Company:

Their book A Village Lost and Found, a collection of stereo photos from the 1850's,
was the inspiration for this project.
