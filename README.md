Simple utilities I'm using to process photo pairs into single stereo images.

A good stereo viewer that can be used with this project is available through
the London Stereoscopic Company:

There is some information on how to manually take the stereo images here:

The book A Village Lost and Found, a collection of stereo photos from the 1850's,
was the inspiration for this project:

This book was written by Brian May and Elena Vidal.  Brian was a member of the band
Queen, which I remember also used the stereo effect, albeit for audio, quite 
effectively!
